In this project, I created a database using MySQL for my church band. In the past, the church has used papers and folders to store all the music. Each week, the song leader would select music from folders and service livestreams would be rewatched from previous weeks for additional information. There are a few problems with this, however. There is not a complete list of songs to look through with their keys and singers. It is difficult to look at previous setlists to make sure any songs havenâ€™t already been played recently, to see where in the service they were placed in (such as offering songs or altar call songs), and to be able to go back and listen to how the band played them. The music database stores data for all band members at church. It lists each song with what key they are played in, and which band member sings them. This list is sortable and allows for the addition of new songs as the band learns them. It also tracks setlists from previous weeks, including a link to the service video if available.
